# buckety-buckeroo
Got streaming data and want to create an approximate histogram for it? Want to also render the bins to a canvas without bells and whistles? That's what buckety-buckeroo does for you.


# Demo

# Usage
You can include `buckety-buckeroo` directly on your page via.
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@marioslab/buckety-buckeroo@1.0.0/dist/iife/buckety-buckero.min.js">

Every function and "class" is exposed on the global `buckety` object.

If you manage your project dependencies with NPM, add `buckety-buckeroo` as follows:

```
npm install @marioslab/buckety-buckeroo
```

Then import all exported functions and classes in your source files via:

```
import * as buckety from "@marioslab/buckety-buckeroo"
```


# Will you add feature $X
No.

git clone https://github.com/badlogic/buckety-buckeroo
cd buckety-buckeroo
npm run dev
